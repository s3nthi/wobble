  <h1>About Wobble</h1><br><br>
  <p>We&apos;re huge fans of Wordle, and what fascinated us most was the problem-solving process behind the game. We got to thinking about optimal ways to solve it and that led us to explore the game from a new perspective. With Wobble, the roles are reversed. The user chooses a secret word (or picks one at random from a list), and the system takes on the challenge of solving it.</p><br>
  <p>Wobble reimagines the experience by reversing the roles. Instead of the player guessing the secret word, the system takes on the challenge. The user selects the word, and the system, powered by a reinforcement learning agent, uses feedback to refine its guesses. Through trial and error, the system adapts its strategy and learns with each guess. This interactive process allows users to witness machine learning in action, creating a fun and educational twist on the classic game where both the user and AI collaborate to solve the puzzle.</p>
